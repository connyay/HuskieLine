A project I started on my own to create a helper application for the fairly confusing bus system at NIU.

Includes all of the bus schedules and a mobile version of the bus tracking system.

This application has been pulled from the market so I can get in touch with the Advanced Geospatial Laboratory and copy the source to my own servers.
